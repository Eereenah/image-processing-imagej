### Digital image processing techniques implemented in Java/Python using ImageJ

The repository includes examples of the following techniques:
* Histogram equalization
* Edge Detection using Sobel, Prewitt and Extended Sobel operators
* Morphological filters: erosion, dilation, skeletonization (the example in the notebook uses morphological operators to mimic the transformation of frames present in [Picasso's Bull](http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/animals_in_art/pablo_picasso/picasso_bulls.jpg)).
